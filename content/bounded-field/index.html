<p>There are a few important questions that popped up while writing many of the bounds present in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08002">this paper</a>. One of the main questions that popped up repeatedly was: when are the solutions to the physics equation bounded over all possible designs?</p>
<p>One specific case in which this question is useful is in the field bounds paragraph in pages 18 and 19 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08002">the paper</a>, though more generally this question can also help answer a number of other important results &#40;which we do not mention here&#41;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this post will end in a bit of a disappointing note: the result given here depends on some condition which is likely not easy to check in practice. On the other hand, it does lead to a suggestive definition I have never seen before of an &quot;elementwise nonexpansive operator.&quot; I would be quite curious to see if anyone had any references&#33;</p>
<h2 id="problem_formulation"><a href="#problem_formulation" class="header-anchor">Problem formulation</a></h2>
<p>In this case, we will again focus on the <em>diagonal physics equation</em>. Here, the physics equation is:</p>
\[
    (A + \mathbf{diag}(\theta))z = b,
\]
<p>where \(\theta \in \mathbf{R}^n\) are the design parameters &#40;usually the permittivities in many problems&#41; while \(z \in \mathbf{R}^n\) are the fields. In general, we are only allowed to choose parameters within a certain range, so we will write this as</p>
\[
-1 \le \theta \le 1,
\]
<p>without loss of generality. &#40;In particular, if \(\theta\) is constrained to lie within any range, we can always rescale the physics equation to make \(\theta\) lie between \(-1\) and \(1\). For more details on how to do this, see section 1.2 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08002">the paper</a>.&#41;</p>
<h3 id="eliminating_the_design_variable"><a href="#eliminating_the_design_variable" class="header-anchor">Eliminating the design variable</a></h3>
<p>Taking this formulation, we can &quot;eliminate&quot; the design parameter. In other words, we will write a number of equations, depending only on the variable \(z\), such that, when \(z\) satisfies all the equations, there exists some design \(\theta \in [-1, 1]^n\) which makes the physics equation true.</p>
<p>To do this, note that, we can take the initial physics equation and rearrange it as follows:</p>
\[
Az - b = -\mathbf{diag}(\theta)z.
\]
<p>Taking the elementwise absolute value of both sides gives</p>
\[
|Az - b| = |\mathbf{diag}(\theta)z|.
\]
<p>&#40;Here, we interpret \(|\cdot|\) to be elementwise.&#41; Because \(|\theta| \le 1\), we can see that</p>
\[
|\mathbf{diag}(\theta)z| \le |z|,
\]
<p>so</p>
\[
|Az - b| \le |z|.
\]
<p>In fact, \(|\mathbf{diag}(\theta)z| \le |z|\) is true if, and only if, \(|\theta| \le 1\). Meaning the inequality we just derived, depending only on \(z\), is true if, and only if, there exists some design \(\theta\) satisfying \(|\theta| \le 1\) that makes the original physics equation true.</p>
<p>The nice part about this equation is that it encapsulates all of the important parts of the problem in a simple-to-reason-about format. &#40;It also suggests some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92451-1">interesting heuristics</a>, but that&#39;s for another time&#33;&#41;</p>

<p>Now, finally, to answer the question&#33; At least partially.</p>
<p>The proof technique here is relatively simple: we will </p>
